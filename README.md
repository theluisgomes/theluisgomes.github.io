Hello there!

My name is Luis and I’m a Brazilian designer focused on creating sustainable and innovative products. My work is about aligning values with thoughtful designs and user-friendly tools.

I believe that good design combines aesthetics with functionality. It’s essential to understand the vision and the entire creative process behind a product. To create intuitive interfaces that tell a story and inspire through elements like color and texture is a tough challenge and to get there, I'm always on Discovery Mode.

Over the years, I have developed skills in Art Direction and various design tools, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Blender, Sketch, and Figma. I also have experience in illustration, handmade lettering, and photography. Additionally, I’m becoming proficient in frontend development with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and Angular, as well as some PHP for WordPress customizations and Python for data handling.

I spend my time exploring innovative tools and programming languages that enhance my projects. Using software like Tableau and Google Data Studio, I create dashboards that help visualize data effectively, and I've spoken about data visualization at Dataviz.Rio. Recently, I’ve been exploring Game Studies and Immersive Technology to understand how they impact user experiences in Virtual Reality and gaming.
